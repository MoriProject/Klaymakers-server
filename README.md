# TTM
## Introduction
This project is a TTM project by the To The Moon team, which participated in [KLAYMAKERS 23](https://developer.klaytn.foundation/klaymakers23/) as The Real-World Assets (RWAs) track.

We created A service proposal that allows you to buy and sell RWA object rights and check and verify rights owned by users.
